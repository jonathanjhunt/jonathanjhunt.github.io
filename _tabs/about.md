Hi, I'm Jonathan Hunt, a passionate Site Reliability Engineer with a strong focus on leveraging cloud computing technologies. With 4 years of experience in the financial sector, I've honed my skills working for one of the UK’s largest insurance providers. Throughout my career, I've developed a keen eye for identifying inefficiencies and devising innovative solutions to enhance system reliability and performance. My journey has equipped me with extensive knowledge in CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code (IAC) tools like Terraform and CloudFormation. 

I'm AWS Solutions Architect Associate certified and am currently working towards the professional level, constantly striving to expand my expertise and stay updated with the latest industry trends. I’m particularly proud of my ability to take complete ownership of projects and deliver high-quality results within tight deadlines. I'm excited to share that I'll be moving to Vancouver, BC, in October 2024, and I'm on the lookout for opportunities in the Vancouver area or remote roles within Canada.

## My Journey

In my current role, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting projects. I've architected and implemented CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions, significantly enhancing software development lifecycles. Using Kubernetes, I've built self-hosted runners for these pipelines, and established Infrastructure as Code (IAC) with Terraform and CloudFormation, which has helped in reducing disaster-related risks.

I've also created Ansible scripts to ensure consistent configuration across test environments, led interview and selection processes for SREs and AREs, and successfully migrated On-Call processes to ServiceNow. One of my key achievements includes developing an automated version tracking tool with GitHub Actions, improving code integration processes and reducing costs.

Taking complete ownership of a previously outsourced tech stack within a short period and serving as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for core applications is a demonstration of my ability to adapt and learn under difficult circumstances. I have collaborated closely with colleagues to troubleshoot and resolve production-level incidents, worked alongside other teams to carry out overnight releases and patching, and developed detailed, real-time monitoring with AppDynamics to improve application reliability and uptime.
